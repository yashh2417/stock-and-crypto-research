We recently compiled a list of the These 10 Firms Were Last Week's Worst Performers.\\xa0In this article, we are going to take a look at where GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) stands against the other stocks. Wall Street’s main indices finished firmer on Friday, with all main indices settling in the green territory ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House. Week-on-week, the Dow eked out a 3.81-percent gain, the S&P rallied 3.79 percent, while the Nasdaq increased by 3.84 percent. Ten companies from diverse sectors, however, ended Friday weaker, posting notable declines versus the week prior. In this article, let’s look at which firms suffered a bloodbath and the reasons that dragged their performance. For this week’s list, we only focused on companies with a market capitalization of at least $2 billion and a minimum trading volume of $5 million. A gamer playing a game on one of the specialty retail company's gaming platforms. Shares of GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) fell by 14.8 percent on Friday to close at $27.51 versus the $32.31 week-on-week amid reports that it was closing stores in the US, often with little to no warning. According to reports, the closure announcements were reported by employees on their social media platforms. Since 2020 alone, GameStop (NYSE:GME) has been shutting down more than 700 stores as the COVID-19 pandemic heavily weighed on its profits. This was further aggravated by the continued rise in the digital age particularly online sales, and video game makers resorting to digital-only access to games. This year alone, GameStop (NYSE:GME) reportedly will close dozens of stores across Texas, and it is uncertain whether other states will see similar store closures. GameStop (NYSE:GME) is a retailer that sells video games, consumer electronics, and collectibles, with stores across the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe.

A month has gone by since the last earnings report for GameStop (GME). Shares have added about 13.8% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500. Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is GameStop due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts. GameStop posted third-quarter fiscal 2024 results, wherein the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined year over year. On the contrary, the bottom line beat the consensus mark and improved from the year-ago period. GME posted adjusted earnings per share of 6 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of break-even earnings.GameStop reported net sales of $860.3 million, which missed the consensus estimate of $900 million. Also, the metric decreased 20.2% from $1,078.3 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease in consolidated net sales was caused by lower sales across all categories.By sales mix, hardware and accessories sales fell 28% to $417.4 million from $579.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Software sales were $271.8 million, down 15.4% from $321.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Sales in the collectibles unit declined 3.7% to $171.1 million from $177.6 million in the year-ago quarter.By geographic location, net sales declined 24.5% in Canada, 22% in Europe, 20.4% in the United States and 12.5% in Australia year over year. Gross profit decreased 8.7% to $257.2 million from $281.8 million in the year-ago quarter. The gross margin expanded 380 basis points (bps) to 29.9% compared with 26.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. This margin expansion was driven by a strategic shift toward higher-margin product categories, including collectibles and preowned hardware and accessories, along with enhanced inventory management.Adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses declined 4.4% to $281.8 million from $294.9 million in the year-ago\",\n",

GameStop (GME) and Canadian telecom company BCE (BCE) are among today\\'s losers, falling 6% and 4.5%, respectively. GME Closing Stores, Planning PR Offensive According to multiple, recent reports, the video game retailer intends to close down over 100 stores in January. In 2024, GME reportedly shuttered over 200 locations. In the past, many brick-and-mortar retailers that shut down a high number of their stores have ultimately ended up going bankrupt. 25 Technologies That Have Changed the World Separately, on Jan. 10, The New York Post reported that GameStop was looking to hire a publicist. The publicist\\'s mission will be to boost the public image of GME CEO Ryan Cohen, and he or she will probably also seek to improve consumers\\' view of GME as well, the newspaper asserted. BCE Was Downgraded by Bank of America\\xa0 Bank of America lowered its rating on BCE to Underperform from Neutral. The bank is worried about the company\\'s debt levels and the sustainability of its dividend. According to Bank of America, BCE will \"underperform its peers\" until it finds ways of addressing those two issues.

In a note on December 30, Wedbush Securities analyst, Dan Ives, wrote that he expects a 25% surge in tech stocks as the new government focuses on slashing unnecessary regulations. On the other hand, Todd Rosenbluth, the head of research at VettaFi, anticipates that ETFs specializing in small-caps will make gains as investors broaden their market exposure with interest rates dropping. While the general outlook for 2025 is encouraging, analysts are also cautious about the potential downsides of the new administration’s promised tariffs. Following his election victory, Trump has vowed to impose steep tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, which could increase manufacturers’ costs.

Tesla (TSLA) stock jumped 3% Friday amid speculation that CEO Elon Musk could potentially buy TikTok. The social media platform needs to find an American buyer, or it will effectively face a countrywide ban starting next week — and Musk is reportedly the most likely candidate. The US Supreme Court on Friday rejected an appeal from TikTok to overturn a federal law banning the social media platform. The ban would penalize major companies for offering TikTok in their app stores. It’s set to take effect Jan. 19 unless TikTok’s Chinese parent company ByteDance sells the app to an American owner, per a federal law signed by President Biden in 2024 citing national security concerns related to the platform. “We believe ByteDance and ultimately Beijing is looking at the possibility that Musk/X could buy the US TikTok operations,” wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note to investors. “Beijing/Xi Jinping has a strong relationship with Musk so there would be added comfort in this deal/potential partnership to avoid a TikTok ban in our view.” Even before Ives tossed his thoughts into the mix, Bloomberg this week reported that Chinese officials were exploring such an option, citing unnamed sources. Bloomberg’s sources said Beijing preferred TikTok remain under ByteDance rather than selling it to Musk. TikTok denied the claim, calling the report “pure fiction.” In the meantime, Trump has vowed to “save” the app. Trump has several avenues of action he could take to fend off a TikTok ban. For example, he could push Congress to repeal the ban or extend the deadline for the TikTok sale. “We continue to believe Musk will be heavily involved in finding a solution for TikTok and ultimately could build a consortium to buy TikTok,” Ives wrote, believing its price tag to be in the $40 billion to $50 billion range.

Tesla’s (TSLA) eye-watering post-election rally may soon resume. The stock, which has rocketed a staggering 65% since Nov. 5, has taken a breather in recent weeks, as worry over slowing demand trends and a rollback of pro-EV policies raised fears of near-term financial performance. Tesla shares fell 4% during President Trump’s first week back in office, contributing to a one-month decline of 12%. Despite the recent dip, many analysts remain confident in the company heading into its critical fourth quarter earnings report. Rather than focusing on Tesla’s first annual sales decline in over a decade, they’re becoming increasingly optimistic about Tesla’s AI potential. Analysts at Piper Sandler and Wedbush were among the teams raising their 12-month price targets this week, with Piper Sandler naming Tesla its top \"buy-and-hold idea\" and Wedbush calling the new administration a \"total game changer\" for the company. Watch: GM\\'s CEO Marry Barra on the company\\'s EV plans “The $7,500 credit rollback is more of a negative for new entrants and Detroit’s big three automakers,” Ives told me on Yahoo Finance’s Morning Brief. “For Tesla, 90% of what\\'s going to drive the stock is autonomous and AI … that\\'s the ultimate story.” Ives predicts Tesla’s valuation will reach $2 trillion by the end of this year, driven by what he described as a “regulatory friendly” White House that will “fast-track the autonomous future.” Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas also sees AI as a key growth driver for Tesla. In a recent note to investors, the Tesla bull wrote that AI and robotics have become top of mind for clients following Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang’s CES presentation. The AI chip juggernaut announced a partnership with Toyota (TM) for autonomous vehicles and another deal with automotive company Continental and self-driving truck firm Aurora.

All everyone could talk about in the technical AI landscape these days is DeepSeek-R1, a Chinese open-source LLM that analysts believe can give major American AI companies a run for their money. Why is DeepSeek making waves and why is it called a breakthrough in the AI race? DeepSeek AI model is several times cheaper to use for professional purposes when compared to its American counterparts including OpenAI’s o1 model. Media reports also suggest the model beat almost all key AI models in the industry by significant margins. CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa explained what makes these Chinese models a challenge for US tech companies: “The cost, I mean, these models coming out of China are just built at a fraction of the price when you think about OpenAI. That’s spending $5 billion a year, burning through billions of dollars a year. These models, the DeepSeek for example, they say they built it for less than $6 million. ByteDance as well, you know, shows that it was built and you can access it at much, much lower prices. So, this really turns on sort of this truth that we have thought about generative AI for the last few years—that you need hundreds of millions of dollars to develop bigger and better models. What the Chinese labs and companies are doing is they’re going straight to the frontier. They’re building with sort of infrastructure and outputs that are already out there, built in many cases by American companies and startups, and they’re improving on it, they’re innovating on it, and producing models that are just as good, in some cases, at a fraction of the cost.” READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term\\xa0and\\xa08 Cheap Jim Cramer',\n",

By Akash Sriram (Reuters) - Tesla investors will look for more details on the automaker\\'s lower-priced model when it reports quarterly results on Wednesday as some expect the cheaper car to help the company hit its goal to increase deliveries by up to 30% this year. The world\\'s most valuable automaker has seen its stock market valuation soar more than 60% to $1.3 trillion since President Donald Trump won November\\'s election with the financial backing of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Investors are betting the new administration will ease regulation on self-driving vehicle systems that Tesla is developing. Faced with intense competition in China from BYD and other electric vehicle makers, Tesla in 2024 recorded its first-ever decline in annual deliveries. Analysts now expect lower borrowing costs this year to fuel a rebound in sales volume. Tesla, however, is yet to deliver major upgrades to its aging line up of cars in the U.S., and it is relying on its relatively new Cybertruck electric pickup truck, with its polarizing design, to boost sales. The company launched an updated version of its best-seller Model Y crossover SUV on Thursday, weeks after its launch in China to attract new customers. \"As the opportunity for growth from Tesla\\'s existing lineup appears quite limited, Tesla\\'s new low-cost model remains crucial to Tesla\\'s plan for growth, even if not to the extent of the prior 20-30% y/y target,\" Barclays analyst Dan Levy said in a research note. Tesla said in April last year that it would launch cheaper cars based on its current platforms and their existing production lines in the first half of 2025, as part of a pivot from ambitious plans to produce an all-new model that had been expected to cost $25,000. Some investors are concerned that the new model may not qualify for federal subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act.

The report expects the global economy to continue growing at a robust rate, however a sharp slowdown in China is expected. Regarding the equity market, the firm anticipates depressing trends across stocks, sectors, and themes. Analysts at the firm estimate the S&P 500 to be around 6,500 in 2025 with earnings per share of $270. The head of Global Market Research, Hussain Malik noted that the policies of the United States regarding trade, immigration, and regulatory policy will play a critical role in defining the year’s outcome for the country and globally. The report further elaborated on its anticipation of a depressed stock market by highlighting de-coupling central bank policies, uneven progress in disinflation, and ongoing technological innovation. Moreover, increased geopolitical tensions are also likely to add unusual complexity to the global stock market. Despite all this, the firm has bright expectations for the United States. It believes that the country will remain a key driver of growth due to factors such as an expanding business cycle, a robust labor market, increased capital spending related to AI, and active capital markets. On the other hand, Europe is expected to grapple with structural challenges, while emerging markets may face headwinds from persistent high interest rates, a strong US dollar, and trade policy issues. Lakos-Bujas, head of Global Markets Strategy at J.P.

Tesla (TSLA) stock sank as much as 3% Tuesday, reversing premarket gains on the first trading day since the inauguration of Donald Trump after the president scrapped a pro-EV policy put into place by his predecessor in an executive action late Monday. On his first afternoon in office, Trump wasted no time shedding the skin of the outgoing administration, revoking 78 executive orders made by former President Joe Biden during his tenure. One of those Biden-era policies that was revoked mandated that half of the new US cars manufactured be electric by 2030. Other electric vehicle stocks fell on the news. Lucid (LCID) tumbled nearly 7%, while Rivian (RIVN) slid 5%. Meanwhile, General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) stocks were up. Tesla ended Tuesday down nearly 1%. Trump also directed his administration to consider the elimination of what he called “unfair subsidies” and “other ill-conceived government-imposed market distortions that favor EVs.” The Biden administration had issued grants and extended tax credits with funding from the Inflation Reduction Act — much of which went to red states — aimed at bolstering the electric vehicle industry and promoting clean energy to combat climate change. The first EV tax credit was passed under former President George W. Bush. \"[EVs] are a rapidly growing market and relatively new technology, but [loss of the EV tax credit] is not trivial. I mean, $7,500 is not trivial,” Joseph Shapiro, UC Berkeley associate professor of economics, told Yahoo Finance in November. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close confidant of the president, said last year his company wouldn\\'t take a hit like other EV makers from the rollbacks. “I guess that there would be, like, some impact, but I think it would be devastating for our competitors and for Tesla slightly,” Musk said on a call with analysts after Tesla’s second quarter earnings report in July. “But long term probably actually helps Tesla, would be my guess, yes … the',\n",

AI-focused startup investor SoftBank Group slid more than 8%, on course for its biggest one-day fall since Sept. 30.

MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor has hinted at another Bitcoin purchase scheduled for Jan. 27, following the company’s recent acquisition of 11,000 BTC on Jan. 21 at an average price of $101,191 per coin. This brings MicroStrategy\\'s total holdings to 461,000 BTC, worth approximately $48.4 billion, surpassing the U.S. government’s Bitcoin holdings. Despite Bitcoin’s recent pullback from an all-time high of $108,786 on Jan. 20, the cryptocurrency has been consolidating around $101,000. The announcement coincides with a significant development in U.S. digital asset policy. On Jan. 23, President Trump signed an executive order creating the President\\'s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. Chaired by David Sacks, the group is tasked with researching the creation of a \"national digital asset stockpile.\" However, Bitcoin’s role in this stockpile remains unclear, as the order did not explicitly mention the cryptocurrency. The executive order has sparked mixed reactions from the Bitcoin community. Max Keiser, a prominent Bitcoin evangelist, criticized the potential inclusion of altcoins in a U.S. digital asset reserve, calling it destructive to Bitcoin’s dominance. Meanwhile, Pierre Rochard, VP of research at Riot Platforms, warned that Ripple\\'s lobbying efforts could prevent Bitcoin from being the sole asset in a strategic reserve, instead promoting a more diverse collection of digital assets. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse acknowledged the company\\'s lobbying efforts but assured that Bitcoin would still be part of any future reserve. While MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin investments have been profitable, with an unrealized gain of over $19 billion, traders are uncertain about the short-term outlook for Bitcoin. The potential shift toward a multi-asset digital asset reserve has left the market apprehensive, as the policy could include inflationary assets alongside Bitcoin. Despite this uncertainty, Saylor remains committed to growing MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings, signaling further acquisitions in the coming days.

CleanSpark is one of the largest publicly listed miners in the bank\\'s coverage, with a roughly 50 exahashes per second (EH/s) hashrate target for mid-2025. It benefits from one of the most efficient mining fleets in the sector which gives it \"strong unit economics and outsized BTC production.\" KBW gave the stock a $19 price target. Core Scientific offers exposure to the biggest and most appealing AI/HPC hosting services contract in the sector through the 12-year deal it inked with CoreWeave last year, as well as bitcoin mining, KBW said. Core Scientific is well positioned to \"secure incremental capacity\" as it has an engineering team with previous experience in data center operations, the report added.

Bitcoin (BTC) may drop to $75,000 should it trigger a so-called 'double top' bearish reversal pattern. A double top comprises two consecutive peaks at approximately the same price, with a trendline drawn through the low point between these peaks. The failure to break above the previous peak, followed by a subsequent decline, suggests that the uptrend is losing momentum. So, an eventual breakdown of the horizontal trendline support, the double top neckline, is said to confirm a bullish-to-bearish trend change. BTC has pulled back to $100,000 at the time of writing, having failed to maintain a foothold above the December high last week. In other words, BTC looks to have formed a double top, with neckline support positioned around $91,300. A UTC close below the neckline level would confirm the bearish reversal pattern, potentially triggering a decline to $75,000. This target is calculated using the measured move method, subtracting the gap between the twin peaks and the neckline from the neckline level. Sign in to access your portfolio\",\n",

Bitcoin's price is currently $101,099, according to CoinMarketCap, following a recovery that saw 80% of short-term holders return to profit. Earlier in the month, the supply of short-term holders in loss dropped to 65% before Bitcoin regained momentum above $100,000. The short-term realized price is $90,541, based on Checkonchain data. In January, Bitcoin fluctuated around the $100,000 level, briefly dipping below before reaching an all-time high of $109,000 on Jan. 20, just before Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration. Analysts have pointed to the behavior of short-term holders, often driven by fear of missing out (FOMO), as a sign of market optimism. These investors tend to buy aggressively during price surges, which IT Tech, a CryptoQuant contributor, says contributes to a “bullish tone” for 2025. Long-term holders, who have held Bitcoin for over 155 days, maintain a dominant position in the market, continuing to accumulate during price declines while taking profits strategically during upward trends. The average long-term holder's cost is $24,639 per Bitcoin, according to Bitbo, meaning most are seeing profits of over four times their investment. Occasional sell-offs by these holders are viewed as healthy, creating opportunities for others to accumulate. IT Tech also noted that short-term holders are becoming increasingly confident, particularly as Bitcoin’s price gains upward momentum. Their activity signals strong speculative behavior, which, combined with the steady actions of long-term holders, supports the cryptocurrency's positive outlook for the year ahead. A separate analysis by CryptoQuant’s “Crazzyblockk” highlighted that long-term holders are refraining from major sell-offs. Only 18% of Bitcoin deposits into Binance were attributed to long-term holders, signaling continued commitment despite market volatility. This behavior reinforces the market’s overall stability, even during periods of fluctuation. Throughout this period, Bitcoin’s market dynamics have been shaped by the contrasting behaviors of long-term and short-term holders.

Nasdaq has filed a proposed rule change to allow in-kind creation and redemption for the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), according to a Friday  filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The process allows large institutional investors, called authorized participants (APs), to buy and redeem shares of the fund directly to bitcoin (BTC). It is considered to be more efficient as it allows APs to closely monitor the demand for the ETF and act quickly by buying or selling shares of the fund without cash being involved. Retail investors are not eligible to participate. When the SEC first approved spot bitcoin ETFs, including IBIT, last January, the agency allowed the launch of the funds with cash redemption instead of bitcoin. \"It should have been approved in the first place but Gensler/Crenshaw didn\\'t want to allow it for a whole host of reasons they gave,\" Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart wrote on X. \"Mainly [they] didn\\'t want brokers touching actual Bitcoin.\" BlackRock\\'s IBIT is the largest spot BTC ETF on the market, attracting nearly $40 billion of inflows in its first year, making it the most successful ETF debut ever.

Concerns that Chinese startup DeepSeek’s AI model will hit tech valuations added to the risk-off mood in crypto on Monday. “The Chinese LLM poses a potential threat to US equity markets by disrupting US AI dominance with their cost efficiency and groundbreaking open-source technology,” QCP Asia said in a report on Monday, referring to so-called large language models. “Now the question is how will Trump retaliate?” The slump comes after the President on Friday ordered the creation of a working group to advise the White House on crypto policy in a long-awaited executive action. The group is tasked with proposing a regulatory framework for digital assets in the US within six months, while evaluating the creation of a crypto stockpile. The order stopped short of confirming that the US would establish a Bitcoin reserve — something Trump had vowed to do on the campaign trail. “Even though the market got 90% of what it wanted with the executive orders, it evidently was']}"

We recently published a list of 15 Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against other stocks ChatGPT predicts could make you wealthy in 10 years. 2024 was a stellar year for the US markets, driven by a strong performance in the technology sector. The broader market expanded by more than 23% during the year, marking two consecutive years of over 20% growth—something that had not happened in nearly three decades.

The stock market benefited from a resilient economy that avoided recession, declining interest rates, and waning inflation. Analysts are projecting continued growth in 2025 amid strong economic data and optimism about a business-friendly Trump administration returning to power. In a note on December 30, Wedbush Securities analyst, Dan Ives, wrote that he expects a 25% surge in tech stocks as the new government focuses on slashing unnecessary regulations. On the other hand, Todd Rosenbluth, the head of research at VettaFi, anticipates that ETFs specializing in small-caps will make gains as investors broaden their market exposure with interest rates dropping. While the general outlook for 2025 is encouraging, analysts are also cautious about the potential downsides of the new administration’s promised tariffs. Following his election victory, Trump has vowed to impose steep tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, which could increase manufacturers’ costs. Ongoing geopolitical tensions in different parts of the world could also hurt the stock market. A growing number of investors are turning to ChatGPT for stock suggestions. According to a 2023 survey, around 53% of the Millenials and 50% of Generation Z respondents had used the AI chatbot for investing advice. In contrast, older Americans were skeptical of the recommendations, with only 25% of the Baby Boomers saying they had used ChatGPT'"
