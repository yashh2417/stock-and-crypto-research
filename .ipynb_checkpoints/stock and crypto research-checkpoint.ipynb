(Bloomberg) -- Almost $10 billion has poured into US exchange-traded funds investing directly in Bitcoin since Donald Trump became president-elect, in a bet that his embrace of the crypto sector heralds a boom for the market. Most Read from Bloomberg A Chicago Skyscraper Cements the Legacy of a Visionary Postmodern Architect NYC’s Run-Down Bus Terminal Gets Approval for $10 Billion Revamp Kansas City Looks Back on its Long, Costly Ride With Microtransit The dozen funds from issuers including BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments have attracted about $9.9 billion of net inflows in the period following Election Day on Nov. 5, helping to lift the group’s total assets to approximately $113 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The president-elect last week picked a digital-asset supporter to be the next head of the US securities regulator and named the first-ever White House czar for artificial intelligence and crypto. Trump has vowed to replace Biden administration skepticism about digital assets with supportive rules and even backed the idea of a strategic national Bitcoin reserve. The Republican used to be a crypto skeptic but pivoted as the industry unleashed an election campaign war chest to promote its interests. Bitcoin topped $100,000 for the first time on Dec. 5 and traded at $98,860 as of 11:55 a.m. Monday in Singapore. The token’s six-week streak of gains through Sunday is the longest such run since the crypto frenzy of 2021. Volatility swept across Bitcoin a day after the token achieved the landmark six-figure level. The swings briefly drove the largest digital asset down toward $92,000, a drop that sowed some caution over the immediate outlook. A “sustained and decided” push past $100,000 may require further positive catalysts to materialize, David Lawant, head of research at crypto prime broker FalconX, wrote in a note. US regulators have also permitted spot-Ether ETFs, a group of nine funds that lured almost $2 billion of net subscriptions in the wake of Trump’s election win. Ether, the second-ranked token, has outperformed Bitcoin of late.

GameStop currently trades at $32.17 and has been a dream stock for shareholders. It’s returned 2,081% since December 2019, blowing past the S&P 500’s 85.7% gain. The company has also beaten the index over the past six months as its stock price is up 28.2% thanks to its solid quarterly results. Is there a buying opportunity in GameStop, or does it present a risk to your portfolio? Get the full stock story straight from our expert analysts, it’s free. We’re happy investors have made money, but we're sitting this one out for now. Here are three reasons why GME doesn't excite us and a stock we'd rather own. Drawing gaming fans with demo units set up with the latest releases, GameStop (NYSE:GME) sells new and used video games, consoles, and accessories, as well as pop culture merchandise. Same-store sales show the change in sales for a retailer's e-commerce platform and brick-and-mortar shops that have existed for at least a year. This is a key performance indicator because it measures organic growth. GameStop’s demand has been shrinking over the last two years as its same-store sales have averaged 4.5% annual declines. Note that GameStop reports its same-store sales intermittently, so some data points are missing in the chart below. Operating margin is an important measure of profitability as it shows the portion of revenue left after accounting for all core expenses–everything from the cost of goods sold to advertising and wages. It’s also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes. GameStop was roughly breakeven when averaging the last two years of quarterly operating profits, one of the worst outcomes in the consumer retail sector. This result isn’t too surprising given its low gross margin as a starting point. Growth gives us insight into a company’s long-term potential, but how capital-efficient was that growth?

GameStop (GME) is a struggling video game retailer that should have become irrelevant years ago. Yet the company continues to operate and improve its already impressive balance sheet. We believe that despite this attraction, the lack of a solid business plan makes it a sell. The company sells gaming consoles, software, accessories, collectibles, and services to a mainly younger audience. It derives its revenue from the sale of new and pre-owned games, collectibles, downloadable digital products, in-game purchases, and subscriptions through the Game Informer magazine. The target audience of the company includes individuals within the gaming community, residing mainly in the US, Canada, Australia, and Europe. GameStop gained attention after it became a meme sensation when on the verge of bankruptcy. The resulting rally is still remembered as one of the hottest rallies in the stock market’s history. It also started the new trend of meme-trading, where retail traders would load up on options on a stock, hoping it would make a big move. While the success of GME as a meme stock cannot be denied, the underlying business hardly has anything to impress investors. The company continues to raise money by selling stock fairly frequently to stay afloat. This, despite the fact that it has almost no long-term loan and nearly $5 billion in cash. The company’s recent earnings report also didn't impress many as its revenue fell over 20% YoY. While the company was able to show a small profit, we do not view it as a positive in the absence of a recovery plan. The software and collectibles segment's growth is overshadowed by the decline in hardware and accessories sales. The company continues its recent trend of not holding an earnings call. Rough estimates would put the company’s cash position at over $10 per share. This is by no means bad. But the underlying business continues to meander along without any solid plan for a turnaround.

(NYSE:GME) stands against the other stocks featured in Jim Cramer's game plan for this week . Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed the current state of the market, touching on various factors including upcoming earnings reports and new inflation data. Reflecting on the November jobs report, which came in largely as expected, Cramer noted: “After basically in line November jobs report, better than October, but with the unemployment rate still ticking up to 4.2%, I don't think that does much to change the Federal Reserve's rate cut calculus.” On Friday, Cramer remarked that the market had a relatively calm session, with the Dow dipping by 123 points, the S&P gaining 0.25%, and the NASDAQ climbing 0.81%. He emphasized that nothing about Friday’s action surprised him, and he maintained his expectation for a 25-basis point rate cut later this month. Cramer added that he still anticipates the Fed will go ahead with this move despite the recent data.

With the Federal Reserve meeting in just two weeks, he cautioned that there will be chatter about the Fed’s decision to cut rates. “All of us still see high prices when we go to the supermarket, right? So we shouldn't be surprised if the CPI comes in hot. At that point, why should the Fed really bother to cut? Be ready for that kind of chatter.

With two more trading days to wrap up the year, investors are likely hoping for a \"Santa Claus Rally.\" So far, the Nasdaq has climbed more than 30% year to date, while the S&P 500 has gained over 25%, reflecting the resilience of the U.S. economy.

Additionally, the November 2024 elections sparked optimism for more business-friendly regulations in energy, tech, and industrials following Donald Trump\\'s return to the presidency.

GameStop, the world’s largest video game retailer, has more than 4,000 locations internationally. The company also has an online presence with its GameStop.com and EBgames.com websites. Despite GME’s dominance in the gaming realm, digitization in the industry has led to hurdles for the company and sparked management close some GameStop locations and take portfolio optimization measures. The Covid-19 era was truly unprecedented on Wall Street and let to the “meme stock” craze. As the unknown virus spread, most US citizens who were deemed “non-essential” workers, were told by their managers to work from home. With no sports on television, many gyms closed, and little in the way of activities to do, many people who previously never traded stocks began to take up interest in Wall Street and open Robinhood (HOOD) brokerage accounts. These new investors, flush with stimulus checks from the government, took to social media platform Redditt (RDDT) to discuss stock ideas.

Investors might want to bet on GameStop (GME), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change. A company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years. The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for GameStop is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price. The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock. For GameStop, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making\",\n",

After a long day, some of us want to just watch TV, play video games, listen to music, or scroll through our phones; electronics and gaming retailers sell the technology that makes this possible, plus more. Shoppers can find everything from surround-sound speakers to gaming controllers to home appliances in their stores. Competitive prices and helpful store associates that can talk through topics like the latest technology in gaming and installation keep customers coming back. This is a category that has moved rapidly online over the last few decades, so these electronics and gaming retailers have needed to be nimble and aggressive with their e-commerce and omnichannel investments. A company’s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. While any business can experience short-term success, top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. GameStop is a small retailer, which sometimes brings disadvantages compared to larger competitors benefiting from economies of scale and negotiating leverage. As you can see below, GameStop struggled to generate demand over the last five years (we compare to 2019 to normalize for COVID-19 impacts).

Shares of the popular meme stock GameStop (GME) (GME) increased on Thursday afternoon after Keith Gill, the investor popularly known as “Roaring Kitty,” shared an image of a wrapped Christmas present on X. While it’s unclear what is inside the gift box, the video game retailer’s fans went on a buying spree on Thursday morning, which helped lift the stock price by 3.5%, bringing it to $32 per share. Till Thursday mid-morning, more than 4 million people had viewed the post, which received 47,000 likes and 8,800 retweets. This isn’t the first time Gill has posted a vague message or image on Twitter, leaving followers wondering what it means and driving up the stock price. GameStop’s run as a meme stock reached its peak in 2021 when a group of small investors, encouraged by the Reddit community WallStreetBets and helped along by an Elon Musk tweet, pushed its shares from $3 to $120. Following that, Gill disappeared from Twitter. Earlier this year, Gill ended his three-year hiatus with a tweet in May. He posted a picture on X featuring a gamer leaning forward in a chair, which suggested intense focus. This prompted speculation among his followers that he might return to Reddit.

Tesla's (TSLA) 2024 went out with a bang, thanks to CEO Elon Musk and one of his biggest gambles yet. While the stock gained over 70% year to date thanks to a post-Trump election surge, it wasn’t all smooth sailing for the EV giant. Here are three highlights from the year and what to expect in 2025. When Tesla released its third quarter 2023 results in January, it warned its production growth would be “notably lower” in the year ahead. Meanwhile, investors questioning Tesla’s profitability picture in March sent shares to their lowest in nearly a year. Another big delivery miss in the first quarter didn’t help matters — nor did growing competition in China. Musk saw an opening and tried to turn the tide, claiming Tesla would finally reveal its long-awaited robotaxi in August. Initially, there was concern that the robotaxi push would hamper the release of the cheaper EV or relegate it to the dustbin. Emmanuel Rosner, a Deutsche Bank analyst at the time, felt Tesla’s focus on the robotaxi came at the abandonment of the cheap EV, which was a main reason for owning the stock. In fact, Musk had said in the past that a cheap EV would be difficult to make profitably. Later in the month of April, after Tesla stock hit its nadir for the year, Tesla confirmed in its fiscal Q1 earnings report it would indeed accelerate the launch of more affordable vehicles while it worked on the robotaxi, assuaging investors and analysts. A couple of months later, while investors awaited news on the robotaxi and cheap EV, issues with design and functionality led Tesla to delay its robotaxi reveal to Oct. 10. At the time of the robotaxi delay, a run-up in shares plus Musk’s open support for Donald Trump — whose antipathy toward EVs was not secret — led some investors to dump Tesla shares. “TSLA has always traded with a premium attached\",\n",

Tesla stock (TSLA) roared to another all-time high on Friday, capping off a huge week for the stock and CEO Elon Musk. Shares of Tesla rose over 4% on Friday and reached a closing high of $436.23. The stock hit a record high on Wednesday as well, and it finished up 12.08% for the week. Call it the Trump effect. Tesla stock is up over 73% since Trump’s election win last month. CEO Elon Musk’s big bet on a Trump win and the resulting influence he is seen as having on the new administration has investors bullish on Tesla’s prospects. For example, Reuters reported earlier on Friday that Team Trump has recommended that the new administration whack a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) order requiring automakers to report crashes involving self-driving or autonomous driving systems. Such a move would obviously be a good thing for Tesla. The company has had to report more than 1,500 crashes to NHTSA involving its FSD (Full Self-Driving) and Autopilot software, Reuters said. But it just wasn't Trump this week — there was other good news for Tesla. On Tuesday, Tesla’s China unit said it sold 21,900 electric vehicles on the mainland during the first week of December, its highest weekly sales thus far in the fourth quarter. The disclosure comes after Tesla revealed November was its best month of the year, with 73,000 units sold, Reuters reported. One big reason for its success: In November and early December, the company offered incentives like 0% interest loans for five years and 10,000 yuan (approximately $1,400) for new Model Y loans. But, no doubt, it is the Musk-Trump connection that's playing a large factor in Tesla's monstrous run-up. Analysts like Edison Yu of Deutsche Bank, John Murphy of BofA, and Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley have improved their price targets for the stock over the past few days, citing Musk and his closeness to the new administration.\",\n",

Deutsche Bank is upping its price target for Tesla (TSLA) following investor meetings where Tesla revealed more about its upcoming vehicles. While the majority of the meeting was about FSD (full self-driving), robotaxis, and Tesla’s Optimus robot, the discussion with Tesla investors and head of investor relations Travis Axelrod also covered what was coming down the product pipeline. “The new Tesla model (we refer to as ‘Model Q’) should launch in 1H25 and will be priced <$30,000 including subsidies (i.e., $37,499 if US EV tax credit goes away),” analyst Edison Yu wrote in a note late Monday. Yu also said there will likely be other vehicles intended to increase Tesla’s TAM (total addressable market), with Yu suspecting “a 3-row longer wheelbase Model Y variant” in China. There have also been rumors of a Tesla van for passengers and cargo, and while the cheaper EV was expected, the revelation of the Model Q name and a new Model Y variant coming to China was notable. Yu and Deutsche Bank upped their Tesla price target to $370 from $295, citing these new products and other Tesla initiatives. Tesla closed up 2.9%, resulting in a five-day winning streak for the stock. Yu is just the latest analyst touting the growth of Tesla’s TAM due to upcoming products. Last week BofA upped its Tesla price target following a Giga Austin factory visit. Bofa said the new, cheap EV will increase Tesla’s TAM, cost less than $30,000, and benefit from a lower cost due to reduced features and cost-cutting. BofA also said it was confident more models were coming in 2025. In addition, following its investor meeting with Axelrod, Yu wrote Tesla was confident that it would hit volume growth of 25%-30% next year, with the company touting its ability to squeeze out more production capacity in its existing factories. A main concern has been demand for Tesla and its EVs with regards to volume growth. Goldman',\n",

I think this creation of word models, like they’re called generally in the industry, where you combine multimodal information, that is not only text but is also videos, but is also sensory data. It might be temperature, it might be anything you can perceive around you, could actually unlock the next level of capabilities,” Argenti said, according to CNBC. Despite high hopes, a potential plateau in performance improvements in AI systems, high energy consumption of AI data centers and transparency remain key issues tech companies will continue to grapple with in 2025.

Tesla (TSLA) stock popped Thursday on the back of bullish comments from BofA Securities, with the firm’s analysts fresh off a Giga Austin factory visit. “The trip gave us increased confidence that TSLA is well-positioned to grow in 2025+ with its core EV business and launch of its robotaxi offering, and longer-term from its investments in Optimus,” lead analyst John Murphy wrote in a note to investors. Murphy reiterated his Buy rating for Tesla and upped his price target to $400 from $350. Tesla shares jumped 3% in midday trade. Following the factory visit, Murphy and BofA claim the first big driver for Tesla is the prospect of an upcoming low-cost EV, which Tesla said is coming in the first half of 2025. Murphy believes the new vehicle will increase Tesla’s TAM (total addressable market), cost less than $30,000, and benefit from a lower cost due to factors like “de-contenting, making the motor more efficient and thereby enabling a smaller battery, and changing the interior,” among other factors. Murphy is confident the low-cost model won't be its only new model in 2025, per Tesla’s past statements. BofA and the team are also bullish on Tesla’s latest FSD (full self-driving) software, currently in beta. “The Cybertruck and Model Y we rode in … drove seamlessly to a charging station several miles away despite abnormal road conditions, traveling on roads under construction and taking a tough left turn against traffic,” Murphy wrote, noting that the minimal interventions needed by a human driver suggest a supervised launch of Tesla’s robotaxi business is near. Murphy said a shift to grow software-based products like FSD would also improve margins. Tesla has said it plans to expand its robotaxi testing next year, and CEO Elon Musk predicted during the Q3 earnings conference call that the Cybercab would reach volume production in 2026, with the company aiming for 2 million Cybercabs per year.

Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) hovered near seven-month highs around 4.6%. After stacking impressive gains this year, some of the biggest names in tech lost ground as investors took profits, rebalance portfolios, or reassessed their lofty valuations. Tesla (TSLA) lost 5%. Nvidia (NVDA) gave up 2%, while Amazon (AMZN) decreased by 1%. Wall Street has just three trading days remaining in a 2024 full of big gains, but markets have been unable to mount a \"Santa Claus\" rally into the end of the year.

Markets have largely digested the year\\'s remaining key economic data points, and investors are now turning their attention to two big themes for the coming year: the Federal Reserve\\'s path for interest rates and the implications of Donald Trump\\'s ascent back to the White House. On the former, stocks have largely taken in stride the Fed\\'s plans to scale back rate cuts next year after an initial plunge last week. Bets have now shifted squarely to May as the next meeting at which the Fed will slash interest rates, as it continues to grapple with stubborn inflation while keeping a close eye on a cooling labor market.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is on a wild ride. Even with the current decline of nearly 4%, the stock is still riding high on a 75% surge year-to-date, fueled by all things Trump, autonomous vehicles, and AI. But here's the kicker: investors are holding their breath as Tesla prepares to report its fourth-quarter deliveries. Analysts are looking for around 510,000 vehicles delivered, just shy of the company's 515,000 target. If Tesla misses this goal, some analysts say it won't crush the stock's momentum, but it'll certainly test whether the hype behind its tech and leadership can keep pushing this rocket ship. Here's the deal: Tesla's success in China is helping offset weaker sales in the U.S. and Europe. In fact, Tesla's China division is on fire, reporting its highest weekly sales for Q4 earlier this month. But let's not sugarcoat everything. Tesla's stock has been on a tear, and while it's been exciting to watch, Barclays analysts are raising eyebrows. They're calling out a sharp disconnect between the stock price and the company's fundamentals, likening it more to cryptocurrency than an actual automaker. So yeah, the stock is soaring, but it might be running on fumes. And just to add another layer of complexity, Tesla's battery supplier, Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), is prepping for a secondary listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange. This could shake things up as U.S. automakers, including General Motors (NYSE:GM), are feeling the heat from local Chinese competitors like BYD and Nio. As Tesla continues to dominate in China, the competition is getting fiercer, and CATL's listing could add a whole new dynamic to the EV market. Buckle up. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

In many instances, we've profiled companies before they became household names.

Tesla stock (TSLA) pushed higher on Tuesday, hitting another record and adding to monster end-of-year gains as another Wall Street analyst says there\\'s more room to run. Tesla shares jumped 3.6%, closing over $479 per share. The stock is up nearly 20% in the past five days, reflecting positive news reports regarding Tesla\\'s — and CEO Elon Musk’s — connection to President-elect Donald Trump. Tesla stock is now up over 85% since Election Day. The latest analyst to weigh in is Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho Securities, who upgraded Tesla to Outperform from Neutral and more than doubled his price target to $515 from $230. Citing \"idiosyncratic tailwinds,\" Rakesh like other analysts, believes loosening autonomous driving rules from the incoming Trump administration, the repeal of consumer electric vehicle tax credits — which Rakesh believes will ultimately benefit Tesla over others — and a more profitable low-cost EV versus its peers gives Tesla room to run in 2025 and beyond. \"We expect TSLA\\'s leadership across EVs, solar/battery storage, and charging infrastructure should allow the company to better weather the storm than less-established peers as the Trump administration removes subsidies for key end-markets,\" Rakesh wrote to clients. \"We also see less stringent regulation on autonomous vehicles (\\'AVs\\') as a key tailwind to TSLA\\'s ability to scale FSD/Robo-Taxi deployments, with our base case scenario implying significant long-term revenue from AV operations.\" Bumping Mizuho\\'s price target to $515 shows the bank is playing catch-up due to missing out on the rally, but the firm\\'s new target implies around 10% more upside is possible. Mizuho and Rakesh see a \"bull case\" of $681 a share if Tesla can accelerate its Full Self-Driving (FSD) and robotaxi deployments, and hit breakthroughs with its Optimus robot and AI development.

A broader gauge of cryptocurrencies comprising smaller tokens including Ether, Solana and meme-coin favorite Dogecoin was down around 3%. “The market is being forward looking about MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin buys and that’s been the single biggest reason for market to go up,” said Sean McNulty, director of trading at liquidity provider Arbelos Markets. “Watching MicroStrategy news is becoming a big part of my day.” MicroStrategy Inc. is seeking permission to increase the number of authorized shares of Class A common stock and preferred stock, according to a Dec. 23 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a move would provide the company, which has transformed itself from a software maker into a Bitcoin accumulator, more firepower. MicroStrategy announced earlier this week it had purchased an additional $561 million of the digital token at an average price near last week’s record high. That marked the seventh week in a row of purchases. Bitcoin has risen 135% so far this year, exceeding returns from traditional investments such as global stocks and gold. Some traders cautioned that markets could turn volatile in the coming day on massive expiries of open interest in Bitcoin and Ether derivatives. On Friday, a record $43 billion of open interest including $13.95 billion in Bitcoin options and $3.77 billion in Ether options will expire on derivatives exchange Deribit. “Market makers could unwind their hedges and short Bitcoin strikes which might make it a choppy market on Friday,” McNulty said.

Stocks closed mixed amid a light trading session on Thursday following the Christmas holiday break. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) closed just below the flat line. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose about 28 points, or nearly 0.1%. Stocks were little changed throughout the session, with the major averages flipping between positive and negative territory as the market struggled to meaningfully extend its Santa Claus rally. Small cap stocks however rose as the Russell 2000 (^RUT) gained more than 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is',\n",

Bitcoin\\'s (BTC-USD) recent cross above $100,000 has emboldened Wall Street bulls. After Donald Trump\\'s presidential win catalyzed the token\\'s rally on hopes of crypto-friendly policies, this week\\'s push to record highs above $103,000 per token has some strategists looking for another doubling in price by the end of next year. \"We remain convinced $100,000 is not the final milestone,\" Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani wrote in a note on Thursday. \"We expect Bitcoin to hit a cycle-high of $200,000 in late 2025,\" Chhugani noted the President-elect\\'s pick of crypto advocate Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission, along with a broader regulatory direction under Trump 2.0, \"is materially positive\" for the wider crypto industry. After bitcoin surpassed $100,000 for the first time, Trump took to social media early Thursday to congratulate crypto investors, adding, \"YOU\\'RE WELCOME!!!\" Later that day, the president-elect announced he would appoint venture capitalist David Sacks as the incoming administration\\'s \"AI and Crypto Czar.\" The move was seen as yet another positive sign for the industry. \"As crypto becomes mainstream, it will likely converge and transform capital markets and change the way we deliver financial services across the world,\" Bernstein\\'s Chhugani wrote. \"We expect Bitcoin to emerge as the new-age premier ‘store of value’ asset eventually replacing Gold over the next decade and becoming a permanent part of institutional multi-asset allocation and a standard for corporate treasury management,\" he added. At UK-based Standard Chartered, analysts noted bitcoin flows have been dominated by institutional investors this year, with institutions buying 683,000 tokens year to date via spot ETFs along with big purchases by software firm MicroStrategy (MSTR). About a third of those inflows, or the purchase of 245,000 bitcoins, have occurred since the presidential election. \"In 2025, we expect institutional flows to continue at or above the 2024 pace,\" wrote Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered. Kendrick expects global pension funds to increase their',\n",

On Friday, the price of bitcoin floated near $95,000, after reaching more than $108,000 earlier this month. Since the Christmas holiday, the world’s largest cryptocurrency has held steady near $95,000, as investors expect the world’s top cryptocurrency to eventually rally in 2025. With U.S. president-elect Donald Trump’s second term set to begin in 2025, the digital asset industry is largely optimistic about bitcoin’s upcoming growth trajectory – particularly amid Trump\\'s pledge to make the U.S. the world\\'s “crypto capital.” On Thursday, bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which debuted this January, logged $475 million in inflows after four consecutive days of withdrawals. Meanwhile, ETFs for the world’s second-largest crypto by market capitalization, ethereum, reached $89 million in inflows. \"The ETF inflows highlight robust institutional support, particularly as macroeconomic conditions improve and inflation appears to be easing,” BRN\\'s lead analyst Valentin Fourner told The Block. Slowing inflation and an increasingly stable economy are also factors making crypto more attractive. Investors are also expressing growing interest in artificial intelligence in crypto projects and DeFi (decentralized finance). \"AI-driven investments and high-performance DeFi platforms are gaining traction as the next frontier for growth,\" Bitget chief analyst Ryan Lee told The Block. \"[D]evelopments highlight a shift toward technologically advanced and innovative crypto investments, though they come with heightened risk,\" Lee said. \"We recommend using small dips to strengthen exposure to bitcoin and ether.\" By mid-2025, the world\\'s largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin, is expected to potentially increase to $200,000, according to analysts at Bitfinex. “Our minimum price target for bitcoin remains at $140,000 - $200,000 around mid-2025,” Bitfinex analysts said. “The current bull market reflects strong institutional demand, led by ETFs and spot accumulation. Historical data suggests we are mid-cycle, following the April 2024 halving, with the market likely to peak around [the third and fourth quarter of] 2025, approximately 450 days post-halving. Historically, post-halving years have seen the strongest rallies.” Sign in to access your portfolio']}"

       "\"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Tesla's (TSLA) 2024 went out with a bang, thanks to CEO Elon Musk and one of his biggest gambles yet. While the stock gained over 70% year to date thanks to a post-Trump election surge, it wasn’t all smooth sailing for the EV giant. Here are three highlights from the year and what to expect in 2025. When Tesla released its third quarter 2023 results in January, it warned its production growth would be “notably lower” in the year ahead. Meanwhile, investors questioning Tesla’s profitability picture in March sent shares to their lowest in nearly a year. Another big delivery miss in the first quarter didn’t help matters — nor did growing competition in China. Musk saw an opening and tried to turn the tide, claiming Tesla would finally reveal its long-awaited robotaxi in August. Initially, there was concern that the robotaxi push would hamper the release of the cheaper EV or relegate it to the dustbin. Emmanuel Rosner, a Deutsche Bank analyst at the time, felt Tesla’s focus on the robotaxi came at the abandonment of the cheap EV, which was a main reason for owning the stock. In fact, Musk had said in the past that a cheap EV would be difficult to make profitably. Later in the month of April, after Tesla stock hit its nadir for the year, Tesla confirmed in its fiscal Q1 earnings report it would indeed accelerate the launch of more affordable vehicles while it worked on the robotaxi, assuaging investors and analysts. A couple of months later, while investors awaited news on the robotaxi and cheap EV, issues with design and functionality led Tesla to delay its robotaxi reveal to Oct. 10. At the time of the robotaxi delay, a run-up in shares plus Musk’s open support for Donald Trump — whose antipathy toward EVs was not secret — led some investors to dump Tesla shares. “TSLA has always traded with a premium attached\""
